<p>This chart is arranged in three plates and is so planned that the
history of any State may be traced from date of discovery to the present
time. Or the important items of history in any period may be quickly
ascertained.</p>

<p>For example, the question is asked, "Name the divisions of this country
in the year 1600 in order of size?" Turning to the circle for this
period the answer is easily ascertained, and is "Province of Louisiana,
New Spain, Virginia, Florida."</p>

<p>"What State was named first; give its history?" Answer, "Florida,
discovered in 1512 by De Leon; ceded to England by Spain in 1763; ceded
back to Spain 1783; ceded to United States 1819."</p>

<p>To obtain an answer to such questions from any history would necessitate
a waste of much time. This chart is in itself an</p>

<h2>Encyclopedia of U. S. History</h2>

<p>and will prove invaluable to a school. It furnishes material for study,
for composition, for examinations and reviews, for topical work, and an
unlimited amount of other work.</p>

<p>PLATE I.&mdash;Contains Discoveries, Settlements, People, Cessions of
Territory, Wars.</p>

<p>PLATE II.&mdash;States East of Mississippi, Governments, Governors,
Presidents, Wars, Battles, Massacres, Rebellions, Population, Capitols,
Indian Wars, Religious Denominations, Universities, Colleges, Births and
Deaths of Statesmen, Soldiers, Poets, Historians, Philosophers,
Theologians, and Events.</p>

<p>PLATE III.&mdash;Contains the same information in regard to States west of
the Mississippi; also an outline showing the political changes, the
origin, growth, and changes in the great political parties.</p>

<p>It is not always possible for a school to invest this amount of money at
one time; the chart will therefore be sold on terms that will place it
within the reach of every one. Fill out the blank below, enclose $3.00,
and chart will be forwarded at once to your address.</p>

<p>No one is better qualified to prepare a work of this nature than
Professor Nissen, and he has condensed the knowledge gained during his
twenty years' experience as a teacher of physical culture and medical
gymnastics into a concise, convenient, and comprehensive manual of
<i>rational</i> home gymnastics. The unusually complete series of
illustrations, all of which are reproduced from photographs, make the
book of exceptional value. For the teacher of gymnastics and physical
culture, the athlete, and the man or woman, boy or girl, who is
sufficiently wise to see the benefits of sensible and reasonable
exercise, no better guide and hand-book has been published.</p>

<p>Spain and the Cuban situation continue to form the great centres of
interest in this week's news. With the continuation of active
preparations on the part of the United States and Spain, the crisis
seems to be rapidly approaching. It is to be hoped that each will
succeed in making itself so strong that war may be averted because of
its probable magnitude. The presence of two strong fleets, opposed to
each other, on the high seas could not but prove a menace to the
interests of other nations; the prospect of this may of itself lead to a
peaceful conclusion through the intervention of some one of the great
powers. War seems a glorious thing to those who have not known its
horrors; to experience it is quite another thing. In any event it would
mean to many loss of fathers or brothers, destruction of property,
paralysis of business&mdash;and all for what? That some point might be
attained, some pride gratified, some enemy humbled&mdash;results as easily
accomplished by arbitration the great blessing of the century. We may
not ourselves be able to do anything to avert war. Each of us, however,
can do his share<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span> toward creating a sentiment in favor of peace, and
thus overcome the effect of the mischief-makers who, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original text had backwards 'c'">crying</ins> war at the
top of their lungs now, will be the first to shirk duty if we have to
fight.</p>

Mexico:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Dear Editor</span>:

<p>I read in one of last July's numbers of <span class="smcap">The Great
Round World</span> a request for further information
about the Empress Carlotta or the Emperor
Maximilian.</p>

<p>We have a little summer home in the same town of
Cuernavaca where they had their residence.</p>

<p>I don't wonder that they chose it for a summer
home, it is such a beautiful spot and the climate
perfection. It is fifty miles in air-line from the
City of Mexico.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>Their residence in Cuernavaca was an old place
called "Jardin de la Borda." The house is of no
importance, but the garden is one of the beautiful
sights of Mexico; though now in a state of ruin,
it is all fountains, terraces, lakes, flowers, and
trees.</p>

<p>The Emperor also had his shooting-lodge about
three miles out, with a small house on the
grounds. Madame D&mdash;&mdash; (who was maid of honor to
the Empress) told my mother that it was used
simply as a resting-place for the huntsmen and a
place of picnicking by the court. It is called
"Casa del Campo." It is also in a ruinous state,
is rented for $100 per year silver, and is used as
a kind of beer-garden.</p>

<p>About ten miles from the town of Cuernavaca there
is the magnificent hacienda of Atlascomulco,
originally owned by Hernan Cortez. The greater
portion of the building stands as Cortez left it,
the walls being in many places five feet thick.</p>

<p>In the orchard attached is a small one-story house
where Maximilian spent many hours of his stay at
Cuernavaca; and there in a small room he signed
the famous "Banda Negra" (Black Decree) which
caused him to be so hated and which hastened his
fall.</p>

<p>There are still to be seen the table, chair, and
pen said to have been used by Maximilian when he
signed the Black Decree. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">John R. D., Jr.</span> </p></div>

<h2>New Books</h2>

<p>From Germany we have received a most interesting little publication for
our girls, and also a most valuable chart which will interest their
elders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fuer fleissige Kinderhaende. Anleitung und Muster fuer Bekleidung einer
Puppe. Von Julie Lutz, Lehrerin der Frauenarbeitsschule, Heilbronn," is
the title of the former. We hope to see an English edition of this some
time soon, for many of our readers may not find German so easy to
understand. However, even though this has the directions in German, it
will be very much appreciated by all.</p>

<p>It consists of a good strong portfolio, or case, containing a number of
patterns for doll clothes, printed on heavy strong paper, so that they
may be cut out and used over and over again. Each pattern is in a strong
envelope, so that it may be kept separate, and on each envelope is a
picture of the garment, to aid in putting it together. With the pattern
is a pamphlet giving (in German) full and careful directions.</p>

<p>The chart is the 1897 edition of Dr. Berghaus' celebrated "Chart of the
World," published by Justus Perthes, Gotha. Size is about 40&times;62 inches,
mounted on linen, and folded in a case; or as a wall-map with rollers.</p>

<p>In Europe, this chart is to be found in almost every railroad or
steamship office, as well as in schools, business offices, and private
houses, where it is used for general reference. Besides being the latest
and most complete map of the world, with the very latest information as
to boundaries, it contains ocean currents, direction of trade-winds,
steamship and sailing vessel routes, coaling-stations, and railroads
(even the new trans-Siberian railroad, about which we wrote in a recent
number) of all countries; and much other valuable information.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<h2>Current History</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 138px;">
<img src="images/tb2.png" width="138" height="16" alt="Divider" title="Divider" />
</div>

<p>The <i>Maine</i> affair is still the most important item of current history.</p>

<p>The Board of Inquiry has returned to Havana and is still carrying on its
investigation, and until this body makes an official report to the
United States Government, we should, as Captain Sigsbee telegraphed the
night of the explosion, suspend judgment.</p>

<p>There has been no way of ascertaining the results of the Board's
inquiries. The testimony of eye-witnesses of the disaster, sailors and
divers, was heard on board the <i>Mangrove</i>, anchored near the wreck. A
number of photographs of the <i>Maine</i> have been taken under water, by a
man employed by the Board. These photographs are deemed very important,
as the Board can get a much clearer idea of the position of the d&eacute;bris
than they could from the descriptions of the divers. The belief is
widely entertained that the Board will report that the disaster was
caused by an explosion from the outside. How the two countries will act
after such a report is delivered, can only be surmised. Of course, Spain
will make her own thorough investigation; the divers have already been
permitted to examine the wreck to a certain extent. It is very hard to
believe that the Spanish Government had anything to do with the
explosion. Individuals,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span> acting for themselves and not in touch with the
Government, probably "assassinated" the boat&mdash;if she was "assassinated."
In that case, the United States can with justice claim an indemnity.</p>

<p>If, however, it can be proved that Spanish officers knew that there was
a mine under the <i>Maine</i>, and did not take the trouble to tell Captain
Sigsbee, the United States would undoubtedly consider it a <i>casus belli</i>
(that is, a cause of war), unless Spain promptly agrees to make good the
loss.</p>

<p>As we told you last week, it is said that no dead fish were found in
Havana harbor after the explosion. Another significant report is, that
there was no large wave directly after the explosion took place. If
these reports are true, they would almost preclude the possibility of
its having been an outside explosion.</p>

<p>It was reported that Weyler, while Captain-General of Cuba, had caused
Havana harbor to be filled with mines and torpedoes, and that he alone
had the plans.</p>

<p>In a letter to a New York paper, however, General Weyler absolutely
denies this, and he writes that he has had nothing to do with the mines
and torpedoes in Havana harbor.</p>

<p>One sensational report printed in a New York paper was that, shortly
before the explosion took place, the guard on the <i>Maine</i> noticed a very
distinct ripple on the water, as if a small boat was being propelled
close to the vessel.</p>

<p>Many similar reports have reached the United States, and it is hard to
know what to believe. One of the New York papers has been telling so
many lies that the Government was compelled to stop this particular
journal from sending any messages at all over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span> the cable from Havana to
Key West. This paper then sent its news to Europe, and from there cabled
to New York. Over this circuitous route came most marvellous tales, and
it is needless to say that most of them were lies pure and simple. The
editor of one enterprising journal is reported to have wagered $50,000
that he will cause war between the United States and Spain.</p>

<p>The wounded sailors from the <i>Maine</i> have all been transferred from
Havana to Dry Tortugas. Dry Tortugas is an island east of Key West.
These sailors say that the Spaniards treated them with the utmost
kindness.</p>

<p>The first body from the <i>Maine</i> was brought to Key West last Thursday.
All flags in the city were at half-mast, and although the body was that
of an unidentified seaman, it was given the burial of a naval hero.
Captain McCalla, of the <i>Marblehead</i>, with Fleet Chaplain Lee Boyce and
a guard of honor of forty sailors, received the body, and it was borne
in state through the quiet streets of the city to the graveyard on the
outskirts. The sailors were drawn up facing the grave; the chaplain read
the service, and the body was lowered to its resting-place. The simple
ceremony was then ended by the ship's bugler sounding the recall, and
the guard at "shoulder arms" marched back to the pier.</p>

<p>It is reported that the uninjured survivors of the <i>Maine</i> feel very
much distressed over orders they are said to have received from the Navy
Department. All but five of the men are ordered to report for ser<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>vice
on the ships of the fleet at Key West. Naturally, they are desirous to
get to their friends in the North, and an effort will be made to induce
the Navy Department to allow them to do so.</p>

<p>It seems that, of the men killed on the <i>Maine</i>, a great number were
natives of foreign countries. The governments of these countries have
demanded an explanation of the disaster, and in case it is found that
the explosion was due to faults of construction or carelessness, an
indemnity will undoubtedly be demanded; or, if Spain is responsible for
the disaster, she will be called upon to pay this indemnity.</p>



<p>March 7th it was reported that Se&ntilde;or Gullon, Spanish Minister of Foreign
Affairs, had intimated to Minister Woodford that the Spanish Government
desired the recall of Consul-General Lee from Havana.</p>

<p>This news created great excitement. Our Government promptly cabled to
Minister Woodford, refusing to recall General Lee, and Spain officially
retracted the request, and the incident was practically closed.</p>

<p>A minister exercises his functions only by permission of the country to
which he is sent. If at any time that country has reason to object to
his presence, it can demand his recall, or, by withdrawing his
<i>exequatur</i>, make him at once a private American citizen, and nothing
more.</p>

<p>An <i>exequatur</i> is the written official recognition of a consul or
minister, which is issued by the government to which he is accredited,
authorizing him to exercise his powers in the place to which he is
sent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span> We have already explained, in connection with the De Lome
incident, how a country may dismiss a diplomatic representative.</p>

<p>If Spain had demanded Lee's recall, or dismissed him for any reason
which she considered sufficient, there would have been no just ground
for offence. It would not even have been necessary for her to explain
her reasons.</p>

<p>Spain's action in intimating that she desired the recall was a courteous
way of putting the matter. President McKinley, in refusing to consider
it, took a wise course, for the recall of General Lee at this critical
time might have added to the strained relations existing between the
countries; besides, General Lee is so thoroughly acquainted with the
situation in Cuba that it is to the best interest of this country to
retain him.</p>

<p>Reports from Cuba as to the insurgents' cause have this week been
perceptibly fewer. It is known that a number of filibustering
expeditions have landed, and the Cubans feel very much elated. They say
that the <i>Maine</i> disaster has helped them in this country, for it has
increased the feeling against Spain.</p>

<p>The condition of the reconcentrados is terrible. You will remember that
General Weyler issued a decree that the farmers with their families, and
the people who lived out in the country, should leave their homes and
come into the towns. This was done because it was believed that these
people were supplying the insurgents with food and aiding them in other
ways. Of course, when these poor people were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span> herded together in and
around the cities and towns, a great many of them had no possible way of
making a living. Starvation has resulted, and thousands of these
reconcentrados, as they are called, are dying. It is estimated that
there are very nearly 300,000 of them, and what food and clothing they
need must be given to them. The Spaniards, as can be imagined, have not
been very charitably disposed toward these poor people, and the United
States has generously come to the rescue. Tons of food and clothing have
already been sent to the island, and almost every day we read of some
vessel starting for Cuba with supplies for these unfortunate people.</p>

<p>The United States Government has deemed the matter important enough to
despatch two gunboats, the <i>Montgomery</i> and <i>Nashville</i>, with provisions
to Matanzas and Sagua la Grande, Cuba.</p>

<p>The supplies have been sent to Key West, to be forwarded from there in
the vessels selected.</p>

<p>Spain, through her representative at Washington, Se&ntilde;or du Bosc, objected
to the use of war-vessels for this purpose, and it was at first decided
to send the supplies in the despatch-boat <i>Fern</i>, in many respects
better fitted for such a purpose. Finally, however, orders were sent to
Key West to carry out the original plan.</p>

<p>That Spain objects to the visits of our war-ships to these Cuban ports
may lead to further complications, for with equal reason she can exclude
our ships from Havana harbor, and this would prevent us from protecting
our own citizens who are in Havana.</p>

<p>The fact that relief expeditions are sent by us is in itself an
acknowledgment on our part that we either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span> do not consider Spain able to
care for these poor people, or that we think that she wilfully refuses
to do so. Spain could settle the question at once by properly providing
for them. This, however, she has not attempted to do.</p>

<p>March 7th a bill was introduced by Chairman Cannon, of the
Appropriations Committee, entitled, "Making Appropriations for the
National Defence."</p>

<p>It was as follows: "That there is hereby appropriated out of any money
in the treasury, not otherwise appropriated for the national defence,
and for each and every purpose connected therewith, to be expended at
the discretion of the President, and to remain available until June 30,
1899, fifty million dollars."</p>

<p>This bill, it was reported, was the outcome of a conference held at the
White House. The situation was considered so serious that it was
necessary that an immense appropriation should be made for national
defence.</p>

<p>Talk of the United States buying Cuba has revived during the last week.
The Spaniards seem to think better of this than they did some months
ago, and it is reported that one paper in Madrid has come out in favor
of selling the island to this country.</p>

<p>It is a question whether it would be wise for this country to buy Cuba.
It would involve the expendi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>ture of $300,000,000 or $400,000,000; and,
again, the people who live on the island might not be a desirable
addition to the voting population of the United States. Spain has
misunderstood this country in regard to the purpose of our proposed
intervention in Cuba. She believes that we would intervene in order to
obtain possession of the island. The truth is, that the only reason for
our stopping the war would be for the sake of mercy, for the war that is
going on in Cuba is uncivilized and horrible.</p>

<p>About twenty-five hundred men have been sent to Cuba recently as
reinforcements to the Spanish army, and Spain is putting forth the
greatest efforts to stop the revolution before the rainy season sets in.
Five torpedo-boats are to be towed from Madrid to Havana. It will be
unfortunate for Spain if she has no better luck towing these boats than
she had with her immense dry-dock, which we told you about several weeks
ago.</p>

<p>The <i>Vizcaya</i>, which left New York on February 25th, arrived in Havana
safely. The <i>Almirante Oquendo</i>, a sister ship of the <i>Vizcaya</i>, has
also reached Havana.</p>

<p>The <i>Oquendo</i> is a very powerful vessel, 340 feet long, 65 feet wide,
and can steam 20 knots an hour. She is said to have cost $3,000,000. She
left the Canary Islands on February 15th, the day the <i>Maine</i> blew up.</p>

<p>The men on board, of course, had not heard of the catastrophe, and when
they saw the wreck they could not imagine what it meant. With these
vessels and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span> the <i>Alphonso XII.</i> in Havana harbor, it is said the war
fever has attacked the city, and the Spaniards there are anxious to
fight the United States.</p>

<p>Conflicting reports have reached us as to whether Spain has bought
war-ships in England or not during the last week. It is, however,
reported on good authority that Spain has negotiated a large loan in
London; the amount is not known. Several vessels have been in course of
construction for Brazil and Chile, and now that they are almost
completed, it is said that the Spanish Government, by agreeing to pay
immense sums, is attempting to secure them. It does not seem likely that
Chile would give up a battle-ship just now, as the relations between
that country and the Argentine Republic are very strained. There is no
doubt, however, but that Spain is increasing the efficiency of her navy,
which is beginning to assume very formidable proportions.</p>

<p>The United States is also busy putting the older ships in good order,
and rushing the work on those being constructed. The Government, it is
reported, has the details of construction of many boats now building on
the other side. One report was that the United States had an option on
every ship being built in Europe, except, of course, vessels being built
for Spain. This report, however, has not been confirmed. For the United
States to have the option on a ship means that no other nation will be
allowed to buy that ship unless the United States decides that she does
not wish to have it herself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spaniards are disturbed at the news of an American squadron at
Hongkong, on the coast of China. If you will look on your map, you will
find that the Philippine Islands are not very far from Hongkong. These
islands belong to Spain, and in the event of a war between the United
States and Spain, great damage could be done by this fleet.</p>

<p>The monitor <i>Terror</i> has arrived in New York harbor from Hampton Roads.
This boat is 249 feet long, 56 feet wide, and can steam 12 knots an
hour. The <i>Puritan</i> and <i>Miantonomoh</i> are two boats in the same class as
the <i>Terror</i>, and for harbor defence they are unsurpassed. Very little
surface is exposed to the fire of the enemy, as they are very low in the
water; so low, that often, when in a sea-way, the waves wash over
everything but the smoke-stacks and the turrets, so you can see how very
difficult it is to do any damage to these formidable boats. They are all
provided with rams. A ram is a very heavily reinforced projecting bow.
Many war-vessels are built this way, so that they may run down and sink
their antagonists in time of war. You will remember that the famous
Confederate ram <i>Merrimac</i> employed this mode of attack as a last
resort, in her famous fight with the <i>Monitor</i> during the Civil War. She
was not successful, for she did not strike the <i>Monitor</i> squarely. With
their immense weight these monitors could pierce with their rams the
armor of almost any ship and sink it.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, February 23d, M. Zola was found guilty of publishing a
letter criticising the Government for its conduct in the Esterhazy
court-martial and declaring the innocence of Albert Dreyfus. This letter
was published in the Paris <i>Aurore</i>, whose editor is M. Perreux. M. Zola
was sentenced to one year's imprisonment, and was also fined 3,000
francs, or about $600. As we told you in our last number, M. Perreux was
condemned to serve four months in prison and pay 4,000 francs. In
summing up&mdash;that is, in making his final address to the court&mdash;M.
Labori, counsel of M. Zola, made touching references to the unhappiness
of the Dreyfus family, the courage of the wife of the prisoner, and the
letter from the disgraced man in September, 1897, protesting his
innocence. The remarks made a great sensation in the court-room, many
people weeping.</p>

<p>The jury was out but a very short time, and returned with the sentence
as stated above, which is the maximum penalty for the crime for which
Zola was arrested. Civilized nations feel very sorry for France, for she
has lowered herself in the eyes of the world. It is almost universally
believed that Zola proved his charges, and outside of France Dreyfus is
believed to be innocent.</p>

<p>It would seem that the French Government is bound to uphold the decision
of the court-martial at any cost, so as not to be compelled to recall
Dreyfus and have a new trial. It is deemed necessary to suppress the
Dreyfus agitation.</p>

<p>Four newspapers in Paris, including the <i>Aurore</i>, have been notified
that unless they cease their attacks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span> they will be prosecuted by the
Government. Many correspondents have been warned to write in different
vein about the case. Colonel Picquart, as we told you last week, has
been obliged to leave the army, and the Government has dismissed M. Le
Blois, Perreux's counsel, and one of Zola's witnesses, who was a deputy
mayor in Paris.</p>

<p>We think you would like to hear something about Devil's Island, the
place where Albert Dreyfus is confined. This island is one of a group,
twenty-seven miles northwest of Cayenne in French Guiana. Get your map
of South America, and you will be able to put your finger on the spot.
In 1852 the French Government established a penal colony on these
islands. A penal colony is one formed of convicts sent out from the
mother country. Many of these colonies have proved successful,
particularly the ones where the prisoners are allowed to work and build
up their own homes for themselves. Australia was settled in this way,
and it has developed wonderfully.</p>

<p>From reports, Dreyfus is having a very hard time on Devil's Island. He
is not allowed to speak to any one, and lives in absolute solitude. It
is said that his hair has turned grey, and his confinement in other ways
is aging him rapidly. He is allowed to write, but his letters simply
declare his innocence over and over again. It was rumored some time ago
that Dreyfus had escaped, and since then the French Government has
ordered the officials of the convict settlement to telegraph every day
to Paris the fact that the prisoner is safely under guard.</p>

<p>Political prisoners are usually allowed to have their wives with them,
but, although Mme. Dreyfus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span> has made strong efforts, France will not
allow her to be with her husband.</p>

<p>There is a man living in Rome who is said to have been imprisoned on
Devil's Island for several years. His name is Gen. Paolo Tibaldi, who
was sentenced to life imprisonment on the island for conspiring against
Napoleon III. He says that when he was there the island was a bare rock
without a tree or a blade of grass, and the heat of the sun was
terrible. The provisions supplied daily by the Government were a pound
and a half of the worst kind of bread, for each convict, a piece of old
meat or salt fat, beans or rice, a little oil, and also a kind of
spirits called tafla. The general claims that the treatment to which the
captives were subjected was most severe. They were chained by the
keepers, fed on bread and water for months, and beaten with ropes. Five
thousand dollars was raised in France to rescue General Tibaldi, but
that only made matters worse, and he suffered added torments. Finally,
public opinion in France combined with the press in his behalf, and the
General was freed.</p>

<p>The trouble in West Africa promises to become such an important item of
current history that it might be well to look into it more deeply, and
try and get a clear idea of the difficulty.</p>

<p>France undoubtedly wishes to have dominion over the countries lying
between her western and eastern possessions in Africa. On the west coast
she owns the Senegal River and the town of St. Louis. The Central Soudan
also belongs to France, and on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span> east coast, opposite Aden, the two
towns of Obok and Tanjurrah fly the French flag. The problem has been to
acquire the lands intervening, so as to make one unbroken line. You can
see what an advantage this would be; for, with the Nile on one side and
the Niger on the other, it would be comparatively easy to ship valuable
products from the interior to the markets of the world.</p>

<p>Since 1880, France has spent great sums of money in trying to bridge
over the space lying between her possessions, and step by step her
empire has pushed its way from the Senegal to the Niger.</p>

<p>England had been confined to the coast. She owned Sierra Leone, the
Gambia Settlements, the Colony of Lagos, and the Niger Protectorate. The
Royal Niger Company owned the hinterland of Lagos, which means the
country back of Lagos, and this is the only hinterland that England did
own. France, owning the country back of the English Colonies,
effectually checks their development.</p>

<p>Until 1890 there was a dispute between England and France about their
West African possessions. In 1890 there was a difficulty about territory
on the Lower Niger, and this was settled for a little while by a treaty
which marked out the British "spheres of influence" by a line drawn from
Say on the Niger to Lake Chad. Say is directly west of Sokoto, and you
can easily find Lake Chad on your map, for it is a very large lake. To
the south, the British were supposed to control "all that properly
belongs to the kingdom of Sokoto."</p>

<p>If France has invaded this kingdom they have broken the treaty, and they
are in the wrong.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other bank of the Niger, England, through the Royal Niger
Company, has made treaties with the native chiefs, and thus gained a
good foothold.</p>

<p>In 1893, France conquered and annexed Dahomey, which is on the coast;
but England controlled the hinterland of Dahomey through the treaties
her company had made with the chiefs. France chose to set aside these
treaties, and said that, having been made with savages, they were not
valid. During the last three years she has sent out expeditious from St.
Louis and Dahomey, and gained a great deal of territory which England
believes <i>she</i> ought to control.</p>

<p>So that is the way the matter is at present. France has the possession
of countries for which England can show her treaties.</p>

<p>For the benefit of commerce, it would be well that victory should lie
with England, for she would open the country to the commerce of the
world, while France alone would benefit should she control this rich
land.</p>

<p>We told you two weeks ago of the change of Presidents in the Republic of
Venezuela.</p>

<p>The new President, Gen. Ignacio Andrade, starts his administration with
the prospect of serious trouble in his country.</p>

<p>The State Department at Washington was notified, shortly after General
Andrade's election, that a revolution had broken out at Valencia. This
is a town two hundred miles west of Caracas, and situated in the
mountains, which, starting here, extend down the whole western coast of
South America.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>The cause of the revolution is not known, but it is supposed to be on
account of the succession of General Andrade.</p>

<p>The Chinese puzzle still remains unsolved.</p>

<p>Mr. Labouchere, the editor of London <i>Truth</i>, has some very good ideas
to offer; he says: "What, in the name of goodness, have we got to
quarrel about in China? Russia is striving to get an access to the
Pacific which will not be ice-bound in winter. It is a reasonable
desire, and will not hurt us. Russia is not our commercial rival, and is
not likely to be. Germany has obtained a <i>pied-&agrave;-terre</i> (foothold) in
China. On the part of a great commercial power this, also, is not
unreasonable. It may not suit us, but it is considerably less than we
have got, and we have no right to object. Considering the position which
we have so long occupied, and still occupy, in China, this snarling and
blustering at the first appearance of a stranger on the scene is more
offensive and contemptible than the conduct of the dog in the manger."</p>

<p>Commenting on what Sir Michael Hicks-Beach said in reference to keeping
treaty ports open in case of war, Labouchere says: "Having heard a cock
crow on a neighboring dunghill, he thought it necessary that the
majestic voice of Britain should be heard also."</p>

<p>It was reported in our last number that England and Germany have agreed
to combine and lend China the $80,000,000 which she is to pay to Japan.</p>

<p>It is not known whether Japan will release her hold on Wei-Hai-Wei even
if she gets this money.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>England, in consideration of this loan, would certainly expect favors
from China as regards the Yangtse-kiang Valley, and Germany would
undoubtedly expect to have no more trouble with China because of her
seizure of Kiao-Chou. Many other concessions will undoubtedly be
demanded, and we may be sure that Russia will have something to say.</p>

<p>It is also reported that the Government at Pekin will try and settle its
difficulties by allotting "spheres of influence" to the great powers.
This was done in West Africa, where it is causing much trouble between
France and England. The Chinese evidently do not realize how elastic
these "spheres" are.</p>

<p>It is to be wondered whether or not Emperor Kuang Hsu, of China,
realizes the danger that threatens his kingdom. He is known as the Son
of Heaven and Brother of the Sun. These titles would seem to indicate
that he is a person of great character and capable of ruling the Empire.
The truth is, he is a very weak young man, and the country is really
ruled by the Empress Dowager. She is sixty-three years old, and for many
years has controlled every action of the Emperor. She has supervised his
education, selected his wives, and really held the Emperor squarely
under her thumb.</p>

<p>The Emperor is securely hidden away behind the thick walls of his
palace, and his private quarters are known as the Purple Forbidden City.
Very few people have set eyes upon the monarch; and among Europeans and
Americans, only ambassadors are permitted to see him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>He is said to have a very ugly temper, and to do foolish things when he
cannot have his own way. This must happen very often, for the Empress
Dowager sees that his way is made hers.</p>

<p>Russia has followed Germany's example, and demanded from China a lease
of Port Arthur and Talien-Wan, granting to her all sovereign rights over
these ports for the same period and on the same conditions as in the
case of Germany at Kiao-Chou Bay.</p>

<p>At first, China was disposed to refuse this demand; but Russia
threatened to move troops into Manchuria if the demand was not acceded
to, and China, making a virtue of necessity, yielded.</p>

<p>This lease gives to Russia what she has so long wanted&mdash;that is, a port
on the Asiatic coast which is not frozen up in winter. She now has her
"sphere of influence" located in a way most satisfactory to herself.</p>

<p>If China leases many more ports to the great powers she may secure the
materials for a "concert of powers" which will prove as useful to her as
it has been to the Sultan of Turkey.</p>

<p>It is reported that there are 10,000 men on the trail between Skaguay
and Dyea in Alaska.</p>

<p>The rush is now at its height, for now that the warmer weather is
coming, the perils of the Klondike will be fewer for some months.</p>

<p>Some very thrilling tales have reached us from the Pacific coast,
although the newspapers are very reti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>cent about publishing reports of
accidents. It would seem that some agency is suppressing accounts of
ill-starred ventures. Certainly, the papers hold out the golden
possibilities of the trip, while the dangers and privations are kept
well in the background.</p>

<p>Thousands of men are setting out for the gold country to-day. Every
small town and village of the United States has its quota of Argonauts,
and they are pouring west to take ship for the Klondike. In Greek
mythology there is a story about a man named Jason, who set out to find
the Golden Fleece. The ship he sailed in was named the <i>Argo</i>. In 1849,
when the people of the United States had the gold fever so badly, and
the rush to California was very much like that to the Klondike to-day,
the men who started from the East to go to the Pacific coast by ship
were called Argonauts. Afterward it became a common term, and all people
setting out for the gold-mines were designated by this title.</p>

<p>The reindeer which were bought in Scandinavia by the United States for
use in Alaska, and shipped to New York, are to be sold. They were to
have been used for relief expeditions, but it has been found out that
supplies are more abundant in the Klondike than was first reported.</p>

<p>There are five hundred and thirty-seven of these reindeer, and it is to
be doubted whether they will sell for as much money as they have cost.
To buy them in Lapland, Norway, and Sweden involved an expenditure of
$50,000, and to bring them to this country was a very expensive
undertaking.</p>

<p>There are more rumors of trouble in India. In and about Bombay there is
a strong feeling of discontent among the natives because of the plague
measures. You will remember what was written in July last in <span class="smcap">The Great
Round World</span> about the curious customs of the different races in India;
how they refuse to depart from these customs for fear of losing caste,
which they hold more dear than life itself.</p>



<p>The great Sepoy Mutiny was partly occasioned by the use of cartridges
which were thought to have lard on them; from these cartridges the
native soldiers had to remove the ends before putting them in the
muskets, and they said that it was intended that they should bite off
this larded end and thus lose caste.</p>

<p>Many of these natives will not drink milk, others will not touch lard,
and none of them must eat food prepared or handled by certain persons.</p>

<p>In order to stop the spread of the plague, certain rules had to be made,
and it is these rules which cause so many outbreaks among the natives.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>The population of India is enormous, and a general outbreak would
necessarily be a very serious matter.</p>

<p>The re-election of Paul Kr&uuml;ger as President of the South African
Republic, while fortunate for the citizens of that country, is thought
to be detrimental to British interests in South Africa, for since the
Jameson Raid, about which we told you in No. 20 of <span class="smcap">The Great Round
World</span>, Oom Paul has not held the English in high favor.</p>

<p>President Kr&uuml;ger received three-quarters of the votes in the late
election. His rivals were General Joubert, Vice-President of the
Republic, and Schalk Burger, a member of the Executive Council. The
President's term is five years.</p>

<p>A VERY important event in South Africa is the completion of the railway
between Cape Town and Buluwayo. Look on your map and see what a great
distance this is. It is just about as far as New York is from New
Orleans. The road is to be continued to Lake Tanganyika (Buluwayo lies
about mid-way between Cape Town and the southern extremity of this
Lake). It is reported that this extension will cost $15,000,000. England
controls this railway, and it will probably be the source of great
revenue to her, for the natural treasures of this part of Africa are
almost unlimited.</p>

<p>There is a very interesting article in <i>McClure's Magazine</i> for March
about Andr&eacute;e and his expedition. The finding of the carrier-pigeon is
described. It seems that the captain of the sealer <i>Aiken</i>, which was
cruising near Spitzbergen, saw this bird in the rigging of his boat. It
was very tired, had its head under its wing, and was fast asleep. The
captain shot the bird, and it fell into the sea. He did not think
anything more of the matter until he happened to remember hearing about
the pigeons Andr&eacute;e had taken with him. He turned his vessel, and steered
back to try and find the bird. Fortunately he was successful, and
attached to a tail-feather of the carrier-pigeon was found a small tube
with this message in it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'>

perilous trip.</p>

<p>The news that the French liner <i>La Champagne</i> was overdue last month in
New York, caused considerable anxiety. This increased as several days
passed without bringing any news of her.</p>

<p>Then the steamer <i>Rotterdam</i>, which arrived in New York on February
27th, brought an officer and six men belonging to <i>La Champagne</i>. They
had been picked up in an open boat in which they had been tossed about
on a rough sea for six days and nights, suffering great hardships.</p>

<p>They announced that <i>La Champagne</i> had broken her shaft and was
anchored, safe but helpless, off the banks of Newfoundland. They had put
out in the open boat in order to seek for assistance in the regular
track of the steamers, from which <i>La Champagne</i> had been driven.</p>

<p>Assistance was sent to the disabled ship, and a few days later she was
brought into the harbor of Halifax.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>ARCTIC EXPLORATION.</h2>


<p>Arctic exploration may be said to have begun in the sixteenth century,
and since that time daring sailors of all nations have gone into the icy
regions, many of them never to return.</p>

<p>At that time the search for "The Indies" was so diligently pushed that
mariners tried every way of getting to the West. Failing to find any
short route to the South, their attention was turned to the idea of
passing around north of the new continent which we now call America, and
this desired route was spoken of as the Northwest Passage. Expeditions
have passed westward a long way in open water north of the continent,
and, coming through to the Pacific, have reached the far East, but there
still remains a largely unexplored and almost impassable icy barrier.</p>

<p>As an instance of the aim of the early expeditions, the following
quotation from the old records may be interesting. It describes the
object of an expedition which left England in 1553 as being "For the
search and discovery of the Northern parts of the world, to open a way
and passage to our men for travel to new and unknown kingdoms."</p>

<p>All the nations that had shipping interests were active in this search,
the English especially. The Dutch sought the short cut for their
merchantmen because the voyage around the Cape of Good Hope was very
dangerous, being controlled by Spanish and Portuguese, who
unhesitatingly preyed upon the merchant vessels that tried to pass that
way. The result of the Dutch expeditions into the North was the
dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>covery of the possibilities of the whaling industry, which they may
be said to have originated, and which was a source of great profit to
them for a very long period. They established a number of settlements,
and explored much that had been unknown before.</p>

<p>Among the English expeditions, those of most importance to us in America
were Henry Hudson's. He made his first voyage in 1607, representing the
Muscovy Company of England. He explored the coast of Greenland on this
voyage, and again in 1608; while on his third voyage he explored the
coasts of North America and discovered the Hudson River. At this time he
was in the employ of the Dutch East India Company. Again, in 1610, his
efforts were crowned with success, and he discovered what is known as
Hudson Bay.</p>

<p>From that time voyage after voyage was made, largely by Englishmen, and
the knowledge of geography grew every year, each captain bringing back
some new items of information.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Russians, who had acquired Siberia, sought a Northeast
Passage and explored the northern coast of their vast new territory,
which reaches into the Polar regions. Although many efforts were made to
pass through to China in this way, it was not accomplished until 1879,
when a Russian explorer reached Bering Strait and the Pacific from the
West.</p>

<p>Search for "the Indies" was carried on with wonderful perseverance and
nerve. It is very difficult for us in these days to imagine the
obstacles that these old sailors had to overcome, or the dangers their
tiny craft encountered. Their little boats would now be considered
absolutely impracticable for long and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span> arduous trips; and that they
should have explored all they did, shows how sturdiness and courage have
caused the growth of the world's known territory.</p>

<p>As time went on, the idea of securing the passage to the fabled lands of
the riches gave place to search in the Arctic regions for the scientific
knowledge that could be obtained from such expeditious. "The Indies" and
their fabulous riches had become known countries which were readily
reached through other routes, and the saving in time by going to them by
way of the North had been found to be more than offset by the rigor and
perils of an Arctic voyage, even if it could by any possibility be made.</p>

<p>In 1818 Sir John Barrow, who did much for scientific Arctic exploration,
secured the passage of a law in England offering $100,000 to any one who
would find the Northwest Passage, and $25,000 to any one who should
reach the 89th parallel of latitude. This stimulated the search. The
expeditions of Ross, Parry, and Franklin made trips which, although not
successful to the degree of winning the reward, added much to the
knowledge of the Arctic regions.</p>

<p>The Hudson Bay Company, incorporated in 1670, had all this time been
actively at work investigating the new territory in the northern part of
the American continent, and all this district became fairly well mapped
out.</p>

<p>Modern ingenuity has not succeeded in accomplishing very much more than
was done by the ill-equipped mariners of centuries ago. American
expeditions and English expeditions have gone farther into the North,
but they have cost more lives. They have been more venturesome and have
obtained considerable scientific<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span> data, but their gain is not in
proportion to the advance in their facilities, and it seems to be
established that the contest against the great icy fields of the Polar
regions is one that will be waged a long time before man is the
conqueror.</p>

<p>The expeditions of our own naval engineer, Peary, are well known to us;
and the trip of Greely was an interesting one. This last was undertaken
by the United States after agreement among the various nations of the
world as to the wisdom of pushing a series of stations in the Arctic
regions for observation. A number of these stations were established,
and Greely had charge of the American one.</p>

<p>Of recent expeditions, that of Nansen has attracted most attention
because he succeeded in reaching farther North than any one before him
had ever been and returned to tell the tale. The case of Andr&eacute;e, who
sailed away last July in his great balloon, expecting to pass over the
North Pole, is interesting for its novelty of plan. He was equipped with
provisions to last him at least two years, and accompanied by only two
comrades on his long voyage.</p>

<p>The question is often raised whether Arctic exploration pays. Probably
by itself, that is, if it would have no bearing upon anything else, it
would not pay for the lives that are lost by it and the money that is
spent upon it. But when we consider that every scientific fact is an
addition to our knowledge, and may influence for great good some other
line of work which would seem to be in no way connected with it, it is
undoubtedly true that the explorations should continue on scientific
lines until no part of the globe which can be reached is unknown to
man.</p>

<h3>COMPLETE SCHOOL SERIES</h3>

<div class='center'>
<b>Price, net, $5.00 until first hundred sets are sold.</b><br />
<b>Thereafter price will be $7.50 net. .. .. .. .. .. ..</b><br />
</div>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>This is the most complete set ever offered at so low a price; it is
printed in handsome colors, on heavy, coated lithograph, double-faced,
cloth-lined material, especially prepared for this purpose.</p>

<p>Among other unique features of great value are the following:</p>

<p>In place of names, numbers are printed on these maps; this makes it
possible to do an infinite variety of work.</p>

<p>On the margin of the maps are indicated countries in similar latitude;
this feature can be best appreciated when one considers the difficulty
of making a child appreciate the comparative sizes of the different
countries. For instance, as the maps on which North America, Asia,
Australia appear are necessarily on different scales, the child cannot
understand, indeed never does understand, that India, Australia, and the
United States are of approximately the same size. In this series of
maps, on North America for instance, the pupil sees at a glance that
China and Chinese Tartary correspond almost exactly in latitude with the
United States and Mexico. That the British Isles and Labrador
correspond. That the southern part of Florida and Cuba are in the same
latitude as the Desert of Sahara, and other points of the same kind are
made clear to the student.</p>

<p>The set consists of the following:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="Maps">
<tr><td align='left'>NORTH AMERICA</td><td align='left'>28&times;40 <span class="smcap">ins.</span></td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'>WESTERN HEMISPHERE</td><td align='left'>28&times;40 <span class="smcap">ins.</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In addition to these, a physical and astronomical chart&mdash;this for the
purpose of teaching geography&mdash;is in itself worth the price of the set.
It contains in picture the different geographical definitions: ocean,
bay, river, town, city, mountain, volcano, cape, promontory, etc., etc.,
etc.</p>

<p>Animal life in different zones is shown in beautiful colored pictures;
life in the ocean in different latitudes is also shown, and also plant
life. The chart of the Solar System also appears on this same sheet.</p>

<p>Schools desiring to examine the set can obtain them for examination by
remitting the amount. If the maps are returned, the charge will be $1.00
covering the expressage both ways; this $1.00, however, will not be lost
to purchaser, but will be credited on other maps, charts, or globes that
may be purchased.</p>

Dionysius, the Tyrant of Syracuse. Dionysius went
over to Syracuse with his four-horse chariot,
called the quadriga, and, much to the surprise of
the Greeks, won the coveted laurel wreath at the
Olympian games. The Greeks refused Dionysius his
trophy, however, and, in his rage, he caused to be
struck off in commemoration of his victory the
most magnificent coin the world has ever known.
The coin was made by the greatest sculptor of
Athens, Simon. The coin is about as large as the
American silver dollar, and is carved in high
relief, on one side showing Dionysius in the
quadriga being crowned by winged Victory and on
the reverse, Arethusa, the tutelary goddess of the
sea, surrounded by her dolphins.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
